# Telekinetic (Work in progress)

[Github repository](https://github.com/Aeliuz/Hook)

## Game description
Telekinetic is a solo-developed game where you get the powers of telekinesis, this includes:
- Pulling objects to you from a distance
- Picking up objects and controlling rotation and distance
- Throwing objects
- Pulling yourself to a static object
- Levitating
- Freezing your vertical position when falling

## Challenges
I was initially planning to make the game a puzzle game in the same style as portal, but due to time constraints I chose to instead make it into a boss fight in a battle arena.

One feature I tried to implement without success was to have thrown spears stick to the wall they were thrown into. I never managed to get this to work.

There wasn't time to create a proper tutorial, so unfortunately I didn't teach the player the mechanics properly, which made the game too hard for many people.
